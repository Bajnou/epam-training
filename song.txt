she leads a lonely life
she leads a lonely life 2
when she woke up late in the morning light
and the day has just began....

she opens up her eyes and thought
oh, what a morning!
it's not a day for work
it's a day for catching tan

just lying on the beach
and having fun
she's going
to get you!

chorus
all that she wants is another baby
she's gone tomorrow boy
